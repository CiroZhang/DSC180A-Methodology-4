**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I think communication complexity is one of the most fascinating topics we’ve covered. It’s interesting to see a purely mathematical framework that captures limits of computation and learning. Even though the theory is abstract, it connects deeply to machine learning. For instance, understanding lower bounds for classification or how much information must be exchanged between learners in distributed settings.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Right now, we’re exploring how communication complexity ideas can be applied to ML problems. For my Quarter 2 project, I’d like to study whether we can use these principles to derive lower bounds on sample complexity or data requirements for certain models. It would be cool to bridge the gap between theory and practice by demonstrating a small experimental validation.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I’d formalize the connection between our examples and real learning settings. Instead of only proving results symbolically, I’d add computational experiments to visualize the communication limits or simulate distributed learners that hit those theoretical bounds.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d like to explore theoretical extensions like information theory or game-theoretic learning, as well as practical simulation frameworks in Python. Combining proofs with small-scale experiments could make the ideas more tangible and educational for others.
